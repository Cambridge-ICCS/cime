For the most part, the names of directories here are the same as branch
names in the CIME repository. Exceptions are noted below:

- cesm2.2: this was created (2020-09-29) from cime5.8.32, because that
  was the cime version used in the cesm2.2.0 release; as of that
  release, there was no maintenance branch corresponding to the cesm2.2
  release.
